    "\n",
    "3. Model Architecture: Add new layers on top of the pre-trained model to adapt it to your specific classification task. This typically involves adding a few fully connected layers followed by a softmax layer for multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Freeze Pre-trained Layers: Freeze the weights of the pre-trained layers to prevent them from being updated during initial training. This is done to retain the pre-trained knowledge and prevent overfitting on the limited dataset.\n",
